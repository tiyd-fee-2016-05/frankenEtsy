#Day 1, July 6

###Day
Day one of the infamous Etsy project.
We are extensively planning our branch setup, treading carefully in strategizing for success. Jordan is in charge of the top-most div containing the Etsy logo, while MB is constructing the nav bar below it. I will probably float between them for some pair programming.

###Evening
I have a feeling planning and strategizing will be updated daily. As of this evening, we are tossing around ideas on how best to handle the secondary nav menu that appears when hovering over the primary one (we initially thought we'd simply code the links via anchor tags into a ul in the HTML, but now we are wondering how we can use the magic of Angular and a JSON file to more efficiently execute it).

###TL;DR
We finished and pushed up our header and plan to finish fleshing out the rest of the navigation tomorrow.
